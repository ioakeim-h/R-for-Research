# Multicollinearity

**Note (to revisit in Regression Chapter of Discovering Statistics Using R textbook, p. 292):** Multicollinearity is only relevant when you have multiple predictors (e.g., in multiple regression or factorial ANOVA). It's not a concern in simple t-tests or one-way ANOVA with one factor.

Multicollinearity undermines the stability and interpretability of model coefficients. Always check for valid predictors first before testing assumptions like homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variance.
